Git hub version of Spy Missions plunker projects:
* [Isolation](https://plnkr.co/edit/7zMVXd?p=preview)
* [Mission](https://plnkr.co/edit/U0m1of?p=preview)

To use the project, please enter your Google maps API key in www/js/app.js. The app was built with Ionic Framework, but can be deployed and run with any web server. Depending on your setup, CORS may be an issue. I used Ionic's proxy to resolve these issues. I don't know if the proxy works if you do not run the project with Ionic serve

For some reason, was not able to use Google Distance Matrix API to get any distance information for locations in Brazil.
